# My Lunar Vim Config
My config files for Lunar Vim, focused on using TS and C#, as well as prisma and tailwind (have their own servers and formatters). [Typescript plugin](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/typescript.nvim) has the ability to rename files and imports throughout project, organize imports and remove unused imports 🥰.
